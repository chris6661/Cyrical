# Lyrically
## This application was created using 2 API Keys, the YouTube API to search for videos and the Genius API to search for the accompanying song lyrics. One of the requirements for this project was to use a different framework other than Bootstrap for stlying, and we chose Bulma instead. Additionally, we chose to use NES CSS style sheet for some added flare and style.

## The purpose of this application is to let a user search for a video and play it on the same page, while also displaying the lyrics of the video to the right so the user is able to follow along with the video. This is to help the user better learn the lyrics to the song they searched for, as well as gain a better understanding of what the song lyrics mean and gain a deeeper understanding of the music.
