### Built With 

 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Foundation instead of Bootstrap?
 * jQuery
 * JavaScript


1.What does the MVP actually look like functionality wise?

2.What should name be? For Paden and Sunsia, what other use for the user do you think this could have other than it is listed above?
* Name ideas: Lyrically, Lyripedia, Lyrify, Songify 
* Learn a new language - ability to click on a word in the lyrics and the definition pops up and maybe also with a picture?
* Memorization game - start the song but have random blanks in the lyrics that the user has to input to test if they have the song memorized

3.Review the 'mock up', is there anything else we want to add to the page for version 1.0?

4..Where does everyones strength lie? 

5.What parts need to be done first, will anything not being done impact anyone else's work?

6.Does it make sense to wait until next wedensday 1/27 to have mvp done and ready to rollout, or should we push ourselves to stay on the usual time frame (mvp 100% done by 1/24) for extra timwe on 1/25 to work on it and play around with it, maybe add a new feature?


7.How quickly can we get the mvp out? What does it look like timeline wise for us to be able to meet up and discuss any changes?
